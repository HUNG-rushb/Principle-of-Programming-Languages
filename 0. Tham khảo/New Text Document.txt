Given the code fragment as follows:

def foo(x,f) = f(f(x))

What is the type of function foo? Note that if a variable type is used, its name is T.

The type of function foo is
Cloze (1):

Your score is 0/1.

1. foo is a function so its type is T1->T2 where T1 is input type and T2 is output type

2. This function has 2 parameter, so T1 = T3*T4 where T3 is the type of x (2a) and T4 is the type of f (2b)

3. In the body of the function, there is expression f(x), so f is a function and its type is T5 -> T6 (3a) and x is passed to function f and from (2a) => T5 = T3 (3b)

4. there is also expression f(f(x)) and (3a) => T5 = T6 (4)

5. The result of expression is also the result of function foo and (1) and (3a) => T2 =T6 (5)

6. From (1) and (2a) => type of foo is T3*T4 -> T2 (6)

7. From (6) and (3a) => type of foo is (T3*(T5->T6)) -> T2 (7)

8. From (7) and (3b), (4), (5) => type of foo is (T3*(T3->T3))->T3

There is only one variable type in the result so we can write the type of foo is (T*(T->T))-> T



def foo(x,f) = f(f(x))


T1 -> T2

T1 = T3*T4

T5 -> T6
f is a function and its type is T5 -> T6 and x is passed to function f and from 
=> T5 = T3
